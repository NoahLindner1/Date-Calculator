# Date-Calculator
This is a clojure project that sums up the number of total days with either two dates already inputed or from two dates given from the user.
The project is mostly focused on using the basics of Clojure as this is my first ever Clojure project. Eventually I would like to add more error checking to this project and re-promt the user if they enter in invalid dates.
